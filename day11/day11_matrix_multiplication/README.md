# Day 11: Matrix Multiplication and Dot Products for AI

## Quick Start Guide

This lesson teaches matrix multiplication and dot products specifically for AI/ML applications. You'll learn how these mathematical operations power neural networks, recommendation systems, and similarity detection in AI.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Basic understanding of Python lists and functions
- Completed Day 10: Matrices and Matrix Operations

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Clone or download** this lesson directory
2. **Run setup script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. **Activate environment** (if not automatically activated):
   ```bash
   source matrix_env/bin/activate
   ```

### Running the Lesson

#### Main Implementation
```bash
python lesson_code.py
```

#### Run Tests
```bash
python -m pytest test_lesson.py -v
```

#### Interactive Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open 'lesson_notebook.ipynb' when it opens in browser
```

### What You'll Learn

1. **Manual Matrix Multiplication** - Understand step-by-step how matrices multiply
2. **Dot Products for Similarity** - Learn how AI systems measure similarity
3. **Recommendation Engine** - Build a simple movie recommendation system
4. **Neural Network Operations** - See how matrix multiplication powers neural networks
5. **Visual Understanding** - Interactive visualizations of matrix operations

### Key AI Connections

- **Neural Networks**: Every layer is matrix multiplication + activation
- **Embeddings**: Dot products measure semantic similarity
- **Recommendations**: Matrix factorization finds hidden patterns
- **Computer Vision**: Convolutions are specialized matrix operations
- **Natural Language Processing**: Attention mechanisms use matrix operations

### Files Overview

- `lesson_code.py` - Main implementation with all demonstrations
- `test_lesson.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `setup.sh` - Environment setup script
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This guide

### Expected Outputs

When you run the lesson, you'll see:
- Step-by-step dot product calculations
- User similarity analysis
- Movie recommendations for different users
- Neural network forward pass demonstration
- Visual heatmaps showing matrix operations

### Troubleshooting

**Environment Issues:**
```bash
# If virtual environment fails to create
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv matrix_env

# If packages fail to install
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```

**Import Errors:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source matrix_env/bin/activate
which python  # Should show path to matrix_env
```

**Matrix Dimension Errors:**
- Check that matrix shapes are compatible for multiplication
- Remember: (m×n) × (n×p) = (m×p)
- Inner dimensions must match!

### Next Steps

After completing this lesson:
1. Review the visualization outputs
2. Experiment with different user preferences
3. Try modifying the neural network architecture
4. Prepare for Day 12: Introduction to Calculus
