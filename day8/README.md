# Day 8: Introduction to Linear Algebra for AI

Welcome to Day 8 of the 180-Day AI/ML Course! Today you'll learn the mathematical foundation that powers all AI systems.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
source ai_course_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run the Lesson
```bash
python lesson_code.py
```

### 3. Test Your Understanding
```bash
python test_lesson.py
```

## What You'll Learn

- **Vectors**: How to represent data as mathematical objects
- **Matrices**: How to organize and transform data efficiently  
- **Dot Products**: How to measure similarity between data points
- **Matrix Operations**: How to build AI transformations
- **Recommendation Systems**: How to apply these concepts in practice

## Files Overview

- `lesson_code.py` - Interactive demonstrations of linear algebra concepts
- `test_lesson.py` - Comprehensive tests and quiz to verify understanding
- `setup.sh` - Environment setup script
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Key Concepts

### Vectors
```python
customer_preferences = np.array([0.9, 0.2, 0.1, 0.8])
# Represents: [tech, books, clothes, sports] preferences
```

### Similarity with Dot Products
```python
similarity = np.dot(user_a_prefs, user_b_prefs)
# Higher values = more similar users
```

### Matrix Transformations
```python
recommendations = np.dot(user_ratings, recommendation_weights)
# Transform ratings into personalized recommendations
```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

‚úÖ Create and manipulate NumPy vectors and matrices  
‚úÖ Calculate similarity between data points using dot products  
‚úÖ Understand how linear algebra powers AI recommendation systems  
‚úÖ Transform data using matrix operations  
‚úÖ Build a simple recommendation engine from scratch  

## Next Steps

**Tomorrow (Day 9)**: Vectors and Vector Operations
- Vector spaces and geometric interpretation
- Advanced vector operations (cross products, projections)
- Applications in computer graphics and AI

## Troubleshooting

**Python Version Issues:**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Use `python3 --version` to check

**Import Errors:**
- Activate virtual environment: `source ai_course_env/bin/activate`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Visualization Issues:**
- Install additional backend: `pip install tkinter` (Linux)
- Run in Jupyter notebook for better visualization support
