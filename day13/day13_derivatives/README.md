# Day 13: Derivatives and Their Applications in AI/ML

Welcome to Day 13 of your AI/ML journey! Today you'll learn how derivatives power the learning process in AI systems.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How derivatives guide AI systems toward optimal solutions
- Implementing gradient descent from scratch
- Building a house price predictor that learns using calculus
- Understanding the mathematical foundation of modern AI

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the Main Lesson**
   ```bash
   python lesson_code.py
   ```

3. **Verify Your Understanding**
   ```bash
   python test_lesson.py
   ```

## 📁 File Structure

- `lesson_code.py` - Main implementation with interactive examples
- `test_lesson.py` - Tests to verify your understanding
- `setup.sh` - Environment setup script
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This file

## 🧮 Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Derivatives as Rate of Change
Learn how derivatives measure how fast things change and why this matters for AI.

### 2. Gradient Descent
Implement the fundamental algorithm that powers AI learning.

### 3. Real-World Application
Build a house price predictor that learns from data using derivatives.

### 4. Visual Understanding
See how parameters change during training through interactive plots.

## 🔍 What the Code Does

1. **Interactive Derivative Demo** - Compare numerical vs analytical derivatives
2. **House Price Prediction** - Train a model using gradient descent
3. **Visualization** - Watch the learning process in real-time
4. **Hands-on Practice** - Make your own predictions

## 💡 Key Insights

- Derivatives tell us which direction leads to lower error
- Gradient descent follows derivatives to find optimal parameters
- This is the same principle used in ChatGPT, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles
- Small mathematical concepts power incredible AI capabilities
