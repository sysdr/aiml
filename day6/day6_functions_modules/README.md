# Day 6: Functions, Modules, and Libraries

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Functions**: Building reusable AI code components
- **Modules**: Organizing code for complex AI projects  
- **Libraries**: Leveraging powerful Python tools for AI

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Environment
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
source ai_course_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run the Lesson
```bash
python lesson_code.py
```

### 3. Test Your Understanding
```bash
python test_lesson.py
```

## 📁 File Structure

## 🔧 What the Code Does

The **AI Text Analyzer** demonstrates key concepts:

### Functions in Action
- `clean_text()` - Prepares text for AI processing
- `extract_word_features()` - Extracts measurable features
- `analyze_text_sentiment()` - Basic sentiment analysis
- `calculate_ai_readiness()` - Assesses text quality

### Module Organization
- Related functions grouped logically
- Import statements show library usage
- Code structured for easy testing and reuse

### Library Integration
- `collections.Counter` - Efficient word counting
- `json` - Data serialization for AI pipelines
- `datetime` - Timestamping for AI logs
- `string` - Text processing utilities

## 🎮 How to Use

### Demo Mode
See the analyzer work with sample texts:
```bash
python lesson_code.py
# Choose 'd' for demo
```

### Interactive Mode
Analyze your own text:
```bash
python lesson_code.py
# Choose 'i' for interactive
# Enter any text to analyze
```

### Test Mode
Verify your understanding:
```bash
python test_lesson.py
```

## 🧠 Key Learning Points

1. **Functions** break complex AI tasks into manageable pieces
2. **Modules** organize related AI functionality together
3. **Libraries** provide pre-built AI tools and optimizations
4. **Testing** ensures your AI code works reliably

## 🔮 Real-World Connections

This simple text analyzer uses the same patterns as production AI:

- **Netflix**: Functions process user viewing data
- **Google**: Modules organize search ranking algorithms  
- **Tesla**: Libraries handle computer vision processing
- **OpenAI**: Functions combine to create language models

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- ✅ Write functions that solve specific AI tasks
- ✅ Organize related functions into logical groups
- ✅ Use Python libraries effectively
- ✅ Test your AI code to ensure it works
- ✅ Understand how this scales to real AI systems

## 🚀 Next Steps

Tomorrow (Day 7): **Project Day** - Build a command-line game that combines everything you've learned this week!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Import errors?** Make sure you've activated the virtual environment:
```bash
source ai_course_env/bin/activate
```

**Tests failing?** This is normal! Read the error messages and fix the code. Debugging is a crucial AI skill.

**Need help?** Review the lesson article and try running the code step by step.
