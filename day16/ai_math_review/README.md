# Day 16-22: Linear Algebra & Calculus Review

## Quick Start Guide

This is your math review week! Reinforce the foundational concepts that power all AI systems.

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Make setup script executable and run it:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Activate the environment:**
   ```bash
   source ai_math_review/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Start your review:**
   ```bash
   python lesson_code.py
   ```

### What You'll Review

üî¢ **Vector Operations**
- User similarity calculations (like Netflix recommendations)
- Feature vector manipulations (like image processing)

üèóÔ∏è **Matrix Operations** 
- Neural network forward passes
- Data transformations and rotations

üìê **Calculus Concepts**
- Gradient descent optimization
- Partial derivatives for multi-parameter models

üöÄ **Advanced Applications**
- Principal Component Analysis preview
- Backpropagation chain rule

### Verify Your Understanding

Run the test suite to check your grasp of the concepts:

```bash
python test_lesson.py
```

All tests should pass if you understand the core concepts!

### Files Structure

- `lesson_code.py` - Interactive review session with 8 practice problems
- `test_lesson.py` - Automated tests to verify your understanding  
- `requirements.txt` - All necessary Python packages
- `setup.sh` - Environment setup automation

### Learning Outcomes

After completing this review, you'll have solid intuition for:

‚úÖ How AI systems represent and manipulate data using vectors and matrices
‚úÖ How optimization algorithms like gradient descent help AI learn
‚úÖ The mathematical foundation underlying neural networks and ML algorithms
‚úÖ Why these concepts appear everywhere in production AI systems

### Next Steps

After mastering this review, you'll be ready for:
- **Day 23**: Introduction to Probability - learn how AI handles uncertainty
- Advanced ML algorithms that build on this mathematical foundation
- Deep learning concepts that will feel natural with this solid math base

### Troubleshooting

**Python version errors**: Ensure you have Python 3.11+
**Import errors**: Make sure you've activated the virtual environment
**Test failures**: Review the specific concepts that failed and re-run the interactive lesson

### Time Commitment

- **Interactive Lesson**: 90 minutes
- **Practice Problems**: 45 minutes  
- **Test Verification**: 15 minutes
- **Total**: ~2.5 hours of focused math review

Remember: This isn't just math homework - it's building intuition for how AI systems think and learn!
